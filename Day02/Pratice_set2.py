# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers. 

a=18
b=1
print("sum of two is :",a+b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z. 

z=2
print("remainder when number is diveded by z :",a%z)

# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function. 
t=float(input("Enter what ever you  want: "))
print("type of t is:",type(t),t)

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

num1=34
num2=80

compare=(num1>num2)
print(" num1 given variable a is greater than num2 or not :",compare)

# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user. 
average=(num1+num2)/2
print("average is :",average)

# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user. 
number=2
sq=(number*number)
print("calculate the square of a number entered by the user:",sq)
